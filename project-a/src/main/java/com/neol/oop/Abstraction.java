// Abstraction simplifies reality hiding inner complexity.
    // involves defining a clear and simplified interface for working with objects while hiding the underlying complexity.
//Simplification: simplifies the representation of objects by focusing on the most relevant attributes and behaviors, making the code easier to understand.
//Modularity: supports modularity by allowing you to build systems with components that communicate through well-defined interfaces.
//Reusability: Abstract classes and interfaces can be reused in different contexts, promoting code reuse and reducing duplication.
