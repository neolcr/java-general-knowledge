Future:

Future is a fundamental interface that represents the result of an asynchronous computation. It allows you to retrieve a value or handle an exception that will be available when a task completes.
Futures are often used in scenarios where you want to initiate a task asynchronously and obtain the result later without blocking the calling thread.
ThreadPoolExecutor:

ThreadPoolExecutor is a mechanism for managing and reusing threads in a thread pool. It can execute tasks concurrently across multiple threads.
Futures can be used in conjunction with thread pools to submit tasks for asynchronous execution. Each submitted task can return a Future that represents the result of that task.
ReentrantLock, ReadWriteLock, and StampedLock:

These are locking mechanisms used to control access to shared resources in a multi-threaded environment.
Locks like ReentrantLock provide exclusive access to a resource, ensuring that only one thread can access it at a time.
ReadWriteLock allows multiple threads to read concurrently but ensures exclusive access during writes.
StampedLock offers advanced locking modes, including optimistic reads for improved concurrency in read-heavy scenarios.

How They Can Be Used Together:

You can use ThreadPoolExecutor to manage a pool of worker threads for executing tasks concurrently. When you submit tasks to the thread pool, you can receive a Future for each task, allowing you to track their progress or retrieve their results when they complete.

Locking mechanisms like ReentrantLock, ReadWriteLock, or StampedLock can be used to synchronize access to shared resources within the tasks executed by the thread pool. For example, you can use a lock to protect a critical section of code to ensure that only one thread accesses it at a time.

In situations where you need to coordinate tasks or wait for their completion, you can use Future objects to track task progress and collect results. You can use methods like get() to retrieve the results when the tasks are done.
